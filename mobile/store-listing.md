## App Store (iOS)

### App Name
```
Dog Duty
```

### Subtitle (30 characters max)
```
Dog Care & Walk Scheduler
```
_26 characters. Targets high-volume search terms "dog care" and "walk scheduler" while remaining readable._

### Keywords (100 characters max, comma-separated)
```
dog walker,pet care,dog schedule,puppy tracker,dog walking,pet health,vet tracker,dog reminder,plan
```
_100 characters. Notes on keyword selection:_
- _"dog walker" and "dog walking" are among the highest-volume pet app search terms._
- _"pet care" is a broad category driver that captures intent beyond dog-specific queries._
- _"dog schedule" and "dog reminder" match the core use case of shift coordination._
- _"puppy tracker" captures new dog owners, a high-intent audience._
- _"vet tracker" and "pet health" match the health/recurring care features._
- _"plan" captures general planning intent without wasting characters on redundant terms._
- _Do NOT include the app name or subtitle words in Keywords -- Apple already indexes those._

### Category
- **Primary:** Lifestyle
- **Secondary:** Health & Fitness

_Rationale: "Lifestyle" is where most household coordination and routine-tracking apps live. "Health & Fitness" captures users browsing pet health tools. Avoid "Utilities" -- it is highly competitive and less discoverable for this type of app._

### Promotional Text (170 characters max)
```
Share the load. Dog Duty makes it simple for everyone in your home to coordinate walks, meals, vet visits, and recurring care -- so nothing falls through the cracks.
```
_This field can be updated without a new app version. Use it for seasonal messaging or feature launches._

### Full Description (4000 characters max)

```
Dog Duty is the household coordination app for dog owners who share the work. No more "Did you walk the dog?" texts. No more forgotten flea medicine. No more missed vet appointments. Just open the app and everyone in your home knows exactly what's been done and what still needs doing.

MORNING & EVENING SHIFT SCHEDULING

Dog Duty organizes your dog's daily care into two simple shifts: morning (walk + breakfast) and evening (walk + dinner). View the week at a glance on the schedule grid, assign shifts to household members, and mark them complete with a single tap. The home screen shows today's progress so you always know where things stand.

- Assign AM and PM shifts to any household member
- Weekly calendar grid shows who's on duty each day
- Tap to mark a shift as done and log who completed it
- See today's shift status the moment you open the app
- Push notifications keep everyone informed when shifts are completed or scheduled

VET APPOINTMENTS & VISIT HISTORY

Keep every vet visit organized in one place that your whole household can see. Schedule upcoming appointments with the date, time, location, and notes. Mark visits as complete to build a running history. The next upcoming appointment always appears on your home screen so it never sneaks up on you.

- Add appointments with title, date, location, and notes
- Quick-schedule buttons for today, tomorrow, or next week
- Upcoming visits surface on the home screen automatically
- Mark appointments complete to build your dog's visit history
- Expandable past-visits log for easy reference at the vet

RECURRING CARE TRACKING

Flea medicine. Heartworm pills. Nail trims. Ear cleaning. These tasks happen on a schedule but are easy to forget. Dog Duty tracks recurring care items with customizable intervals -- weekly, biweekly, monthly, or every three months. Each item shows how many days until it's due (or how overdue it is), so nothing slips.

- Track any recurring care task with custom intervals
- Due-date countdown shows days remaining or overdue status
- Quick-add presets for common tasks: flea medicine, heartworm pill, nail trim, ear cleaning
- Mark items done with one tap and the next due date resets automatically
- Clear visual warnings when items are due or overdue

BUILT FOR HOUSEHOLDS, NOT INDIVIDUALS

Dog Duty is designed from the ground up for shared responsibility. Create a household in seconds, then share a simple invite code so your partner, roommate, or family members can join. Everyone sees the same schedule, the same appointments, and the same recurring care items -- fully synced in real time.

- Create a household and get a shareable invite code
- Invite family members, partners, or roommates instantly
- Real-time sync powered by Convex -- changes appear for everyone immediately
- See all household members and who completed each task
- No accounts to manage -- just a name and email to get started

WHY DOG DUTY?

We built Dog Duty because we kept having the same conversation: "Did you feed her?" "I thought you were walking him this morning." Sound familiar? Dog Duty replaces guesswork with clarity. It's fast, focused, and designed to be opened in five seconds, not five minutes.

Dog Duty is free to use. Download it today and finally stop wondering whose turn it is.

## ASO Strategy Notes

### Target Search Terms

| Term | Monthly Volume (est.) | Competition | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| dog walker | Very High | High | Captures broad intent; users searching this may want coordination, not just a service |
| pet care | Very High | High | Category-level term; subtitle and description target this |
| dog schedule | Medium | Low | Direct match to core feature; low competition means faster ranking |
| puppy tracker | Medium | Medium | New dog owners are high-intent installers; captures "tracker" queries |
| dog walking | Very High | High | Second-highest pet app search term after "dog walker" |
| pet health | High | Medium | Matches vet and recurring care features |
| vet tracker | Low | Very Low | Niche but high-intent; almost no competition |
| dog reminder | Medium | Low | Matches notification and recurring care use case |
| pet planner | Low | Very Low | Low volume but extremely high relevance and near-zero competition |
| walk log | Low | Very Low | Exact match for shift completion logging |

### Competitive Positioning

Dog Duty occupies a fundamentally different category from the dominant pet apps:

- **Wag / Rover:** These are dog-walking *marketplaces* that connect owners with hired walkers. Dog Duty is for the people who already live with the dog. There is no marketplace, no payments, no strangers. The overlap is in search terms, not in function.
- **Pet care reminder apps (e.g., Puppy Planner, Pet Care Tracker):** These are single-user apps. They track one person's tasks. Dog Duty is multi-user by design -- the household model with invite codes and real-time sync is the core differentiator.
- **Generic shared to-do apps (e.g., Todoist, Any.do, OurHome):** These can technically be used for dog care but require manual setup and have no domain-specific features like AM/PM shift scheduling, vet visit tracking, or recurring care countdowns.

**The positioning statement:** Dog Duty is the only app purpose-built for households to coordinate daily dog care together. It is not a dog-walking service. It is not a single-user reminder app. It is a shared coordination tool for the people who already take care of your dog.

### Localization Priority
1. English (US) -- launch language
2. English (UK/AU) -- minimal adaptation needed (spelling only)
3. Spanish (US) -- large domestic audience
4. French (Canada) -- if pursuing Canadian market
